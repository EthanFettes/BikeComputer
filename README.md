 ENGI 5800 Design Project
 
A device used to calculate speed and distance traveled on a bicycle using an Intel Galileo

_"Design an Intel Galileo based bicycle speedometer and odometer with local display, data log and Bluetooth connection"_
 
## Functionality
This project has the following features:
* Calculate bicycle speed and total distance based on the time per wheel revolution
* Log speed and distance data to a CSV file on an SD card
* Connect to a phone app via bluetooth to monitor speed and distance, as well as change the wheel diameter
* Display speed and distance data on a local 16x2 character LCD
